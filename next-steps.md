Development Plan
================

Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (2-3 weeks)
----------------------------------------

### Set Up Deno Backend (Days 1-5)

-   Install Deno and create basic Oak server structure
-   Design your API endpoints based on frontend needs
-   Set up database connections (if you're using a database)
-   Implement basic CRUD operations for user data, exercises, etc.

### Authentication System (Days 6-10)

-   Implement JWT-based authentication in the Deno backend
-   Add user registration, login, password reset flows
-   Connect the auth endpoints to your existing login/signup UI
-   Add protected routes in both frontend and backend

### External API Integration (Days 11-15)

-   Get API keys for USDA Food Database and TheMealDB
-   Create service classes in your backend to handle API interactions
-   Build caching mechanisms to avoid rate limits and improve performance
-   Implement the ingredient mapping system to connect USDA data with recipes

Phase 2: Data Flow & Features (2-3 weeks)
-----------------------------------------

### Connect Frontend to Backend (Days 16-20)

-   Replace mock data with actual API calls in your frontend
-   Implement proper error handling and loading states
-   Add data persistence for user entries (workouts, food logs, etc.)
-   Test the full flow of data from UI to database and back

### Chart Implementation (Days 21-25)

-   Integrate the Recharts components we've designed
-   Connect them to real data from your backend
-   Add interactive features (date ranges, filtering)
-   Optimize chart performance for mobile devices

### User Profile & Settings (Days 26-30)

-   Implement user profile page with settings
-   Add features for tracking goals and preferences
-   Build calorie calculation system based on user metrics
-   Create onboarding flow for new users

Phase 3: Polish & Launch (1-2 weeks)
------------------------------------

### Testing & Bug Fixes (Days 31-35)

-   Perform cross-browser and responsive testing
-   Fix any bugs or usability issues
-   Optimize performance for slower connections
-   Ensure consistency across different screen sizes

### Deployment Setup (Days 36-40)

-   Set up deployment environments for frontend and backend
-   Configure CI/CD pipelines
-   Implement monitoring and logging
-   Perform security review

Immediate Next Steps (This Week)
--------------------------------

-   Start with the Deno backend - This is the foundation everything else will build on
-   Set up authentication - You already have the UI; now you need the backend logic
-   Get your API keys - This can take time for approval, so start the process now
-   Create a development database - You'll need somewhere to store user data
